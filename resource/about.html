    <h2>What is Kivodle?</h2>
    <p>
        A game where you guess a playable student (character) from the mobile game
        "<a href="https://bluearchive.jp/">Blue Archive</a>". Use clues based on the student's traits to deduce
        the correct answer.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a student from the dropdown list and click "Guess".</li>
        <li>
            The game compares your chosen student with the correct answer across five categories: "Weapon",
            "Class", "School", "Attack Type", and "Release Date".<br>
            A <span class="same">green background</span> indicates a match, while a <span
                class="wrong">red background</span> indicates a mismatch.
            For "Release Date", you'll also see whether the correct student's release date is before or after
            your chosen student's.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deduce the correct student within five guesses based on the clues from step 2 to win the
            game. Failing to do so results in a game over.
        </li>
    </ol>
